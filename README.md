Server uptime recording and notification system.

This is a simple python script that I implemented to do basic webserver / database server uptime monitoring.  Nothing that was available at the time of writing was cost effective or flexible enough to hit all of the different services that we were utilizing.  I provide it here for posterity.  Don't hesitate to contact me with questions.
